This is a little experiment, and an old one as well, where I was building little "windows" within a canvas to display different types of information.
You can minimize and maximize the frames, display strings, progressbars, pictures and a tree-like group of strings, but you just need to implement an interface to display your own objects.
You will need to tweak it to make it work nicely in windows.
